# MyCurrencyConverter

A simple project used for converting currencies.
This project is divided into 2 parts (branches): 
master - without Dagger Hilt
development - with Dagger Hilt

In this project I used:
- Retrofit
- MVVM architecture
- Dagger Hilt (development branch)

The purpose of this app was to quickly build an MVVM app in order to show the way of constructing apps and to show the difference which comes by using Dagger Hilt.
